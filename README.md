## Description

This pack of sounds replaces the next things in most maps:

* Any dialgue mentioning Gordon Freeman or any other charactera as the player is now replaced with a generic mention (since you do not play as anyone with a name), this includes some G-Man lines as well.
* Any other mention about the players being just one individual were cut or replaced to insinuate you are a group of people
* Really bad voice acting has been enhanced
* Unintelligible mumbling due to poor quality or recording of voices or bad accents has all been replaced with AI generated new voices
* Some dialogues only have their volume up, since they were barely heard in-game
* One or two non-dialogue sounds were fixed because they were broken and wouldn't work ingame, or were missing
